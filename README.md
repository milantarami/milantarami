### Namaste

I am a full-stack developer working mainly with the following stack of technologies:

- Programming: PHP, Javascript (ES6), SQL, HTML, CSS, SCSS
- SQL Databases: MySQL
- Frameworks & Libraries: Laravel, React JS, Bootstrap, Tailwind
- Operating System: Ubuntu Linux
- Others skills: Git, REST API, SSH

Taking web development as a profession not only fulfills my pocket but also my heart because it has been my passion since my early teenage. I believe that people should do things which they are good at or in which their heart lays.
